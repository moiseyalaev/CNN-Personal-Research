# CNN-Research-

Conducted personal research with my partner Naoya Kumagai over the course of several months on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). There are subclass of neural networks that are architected for the task of identifying and analyzing visual imagery. Our goal was to demenstrate a solid understanding of this variety of Neural Neworks both mathematically and practically using the MNIST dataset. Additonally, we created a final report to summarize our process which followed a machine learnig research paper model.

There are three main elements of this project: 

1. **The Presentation** (best if veiwed first for an overview of the project) <br/>
  a. Introducing the histroical background of CNNs <br/>
  b. Their utility and abundance in the real world <br/>
  c. Foward propogation of CNNs <br/>
  d. Backpropogation of CNNs <br/>
  e. Experiment and Results <br/>
  
2. **The Experiment** <br/>
  a. Created a CNN model using keras on a colab notebook <br/>
  b. Model trained 10 times using the the MNIST dataset <br/>
  c. Tested error of recognition using a 10,000 image training set <br/>
  d. Modeled results with graphs <br/>
  
3. **The Reseach Report** <br/>
  a. Abstract and Introduction of CNNs <br/>
  b. Mathematical foundation of CNNs <br/>
  c. Our experiment <br/>
  d. Conclusion <br/>
